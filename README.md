# RationalGeometry
This library is designed to do computations on 2-D and 3-D geometry using exact rational numbers.

This code has been separated out of the old code for Sunlit World Scheme. I thought it would be useful independently.
Sunlit World Scheme used to be licensed under the GPL2, but since I own the code, I am relicensing the
parts that appear here under the Apache 2.0 License.

Please be warned that the API is not stable yet.
